# Project Title

Blockchain: Consolidated Buyer Account

## Project concept

Buyers often create user accounts on e-commerce, and other service websites that store their address and payment information. These different websites have varying levels of security. This project proposes a buyer account concept where the user can store their shipping/billing address and payment information on a smart contract on a blockchain that can be used to interact with payment method APIs and e-commerce fulfillment solutions directly.

Users can create multiple buyer accounts and manage them using a buyer registry.
