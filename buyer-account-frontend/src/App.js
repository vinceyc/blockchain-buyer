Trax SAS outsole, thin midsole and massive toe patch give it a true sock-like fit, without sacrificing security.

The VelcroÂ® closures are designed to push your foot forward to get power into your toes so you can work small holds and overhanging terrain. The heel is crafted for stability, with very firm rubber on the inside edge that resists being deformed under torsion so you can set a heel hook and bear down on it. Shaped like a classic slipper, the Otaki is a precision instrument that sings on the sharp end.',
